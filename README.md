### Kia
Simple dhivehi TTS

### Overview
Dhivehi is probably the easiest language to make a TTS as each akuru + fili = a unique sound.  
So why not create all the possible audio for these combinations and combine them to make TTS?  
The audios were cropped samples from an english TTS. It doesnt sound natural but its something  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 16+ [tested on 19.4]  
- Python2  
- python wav module [comes installed by default i guess]  
- aplay [module for playing audio, also by default]

### Installing
As long as adu.bin and index.txt is in same folder as kia.py you are good to go.    
```
$python kia.py  
enter thaana: ހެލޯ ދުނިޔެ
```

### Contributing
It would probably be nice to have all these akuru+fili audio clips recorded by a Maldivian to get proper pronounciation.  
/dev branch has the resources and adu packer
