### Kia v5.0
Simple dhivehi TTS

### Overview
Dhivehi is probably the easiest language to make a TTS as each akuru + fili = a unique sound. It doesnt sound natural but its something  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
So why not create all the possible audio for these combinations and combine them to make TTS?  
Thats exactly what this does, the audios were cropped samples from an english TTS.  

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 16+ [tested on 19.4]  
- Python2  
- python wav module [comes installed by default i guess]  
- aplay [module for playing audio, also by default]

### Installing
As long as adu.bin and index.txt is in same folder as kia.py you are good to go.    
```
$python kia.py  
enter thaana: <enter thaana here>
```

### Contributing
It would probably be nice to have all these akuru+fili audio clips recorded by a Maldivian to get proper pronounciation.
